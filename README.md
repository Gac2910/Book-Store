# Book-Store
This is a CRUD application to manage a library of books. It uses Express, MySQL and EJS. In this project express is serving the views, so the backend and frontend are one. The database contains tables for books, readers and loans. Bootstrap was heavily used to improve the responsiveness of the application.

'npm i' to install the modules. 
'npm start' to begin server on local machine.
